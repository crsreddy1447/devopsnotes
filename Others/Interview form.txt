Hi 
We are here to help the candidate to crack the interview with confidence and skill ,through our process
Basically here we will have three levels of interview

We are conducting this sessions to over come Frauds, Fake middle man, and Proxy interview.
On an average of 30-50k are charged for proxy. But the person who gets selected is not worthy. So to overcome those we are planned to have a mock interview for them. 

So indirectly we are developing skills and confidence in that person and making him to crack the interview.
And making a person to get a job.

For that I got an idea of conducting skill and experience based mock interview at low cost

Process of Interview is:
1st Level of Interview will be "FREE" with out any Feed Back.
2nd Level of Interview will be Paid with Feed back with answers to questions, Recording and areas to Improve.
3rd Level of Interview will be Paid with Feed back with answers to questions, Recording and areas to Improve **

For each and every round there is a time gap
2nd Level will be conducted after 7 days of 1st Level by other person
3rd Level will be conducted after 15 days of 2nd Level by other person/s

I hope us will make me success in this Idea

Thanks in Advance...............................................................
