Kubernetes Options for Installation
1. Bare-Metal Installations:
     Start from OS
     Install Every Component
     K8s the hard way
     Other Managed Installations:
      Start from OS
      You need not install every component
2. Popular options
      minikube (developer)
      micro k8s (developer)
      kube-admin
      kops
3. Cloud-Provider Installations:
You will get k8s as a service.
You need to take care of nodes. Masters generally will be managed by cloud-providers
Popular options:
GKE
AKS
EKS Refer Here for complete list of providers
Installation Steps
Setup Details:

1. Four ubuntu 16.04 machines
2. One will be master
3. other 3 will nodes
4. Ensure all the four machines can communicate with each other
5. We will be kubeadm and we will follow official k8s documentation over here
Login into all nodes, become root user and install docker using steps from here


# Install Docker CE
## Set up the repository:
### Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS
apt-get update && apt-get install \
  apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

### Add Docker’s official GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -

### Add Docker apt repository.
add-apt-repository \
  "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) \
  stable"

## Install Docker CE.
apt-get update && apt-get install \
  containerd.io=1.2.10-3 \
  docker-ce=5:19.03.4~3-0~ubuntu-$(lsb_release -cs) \
  docker-ce-cli=5:19.03.4~3-0~ubuntu-$(lsb_release -cs)

# Setup daemon.
cat > /etc/docker/daemon.json <<EOF
{
  "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"],
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "100m"
  },
  "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
EOF

mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d

# Restart docker.
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart docker

--> Install the kubelet, kubeadm and kubctl on all nodes from here

kubeadm: the command to bootstrap the cluster.

kubelet: the component that runs on all of the machines in your cluster and does things like starting pods and containers.

kubectl: the command line util to talk to your cluster.

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https curl
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
EOF
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl



Necessary software’s are present on your nodes

we need to create k8s cluster. For creating cluster. Refer documentation from here

Login into master node as a root user

kubeadm init
If kubeadm is able to install succesfully, it gives some info at the end which looks like
To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 172.31.29.1:6443 --token o38veh.5g6zhgfaafg5zzk3 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:bd735d51e2beceaa9c4aba6f32ef6d91dabdfb51d93a9f8bcb41c51e9c5f45d9

Pod networking is enabled only after you install pod network.
kubectl apply -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')"
Now login into nodes as a root user and execute kubeadm join command with necessary arguments which you have copied.
Basic Commands to execute after kubeadm installation in master
kubctl get nodes
kubectl get nodes -w # watch the output changes 
kubectl get nodes -o wide # more info
kubectl get pods # List all the pods you created
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces   # Lists all the pods in the cluster irrespective of who created
