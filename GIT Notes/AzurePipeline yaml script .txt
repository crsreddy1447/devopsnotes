AZURE PIPELINE YAML

A job is a linear series of steps. Steps can be tasks, scripts, or references to external templates.

This hierarchy is reflected in the structure of a YAML file like:
---
Pipeline
 -Stage A
   Job 1
    Step 1.1
    Step 1.2
...
   Job 2
    Step 2.1
    Step 2.2
...
 -Stage B
...

trigger:
- master

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

steps:
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'restore'
    feedsToUse: 'select'
    vstsFeed: 'my-vsts-feed' # A series of numbers and letters

- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'build'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
  displayName: 'dotnet build $(buildConfiguration)'
