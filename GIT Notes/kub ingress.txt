docker version
docker volumes
how to restart docker multiple times
$ docker run --restart=always redis  # restart always so that if the container exits.
$ docker run --restart=on-failure:10 redis # restart policy of on-failure and a maximum restart count of 10

how to configure a container with specific size and memory
1. Limit Docker Container Memory Access
There are several RAM limitations you can set for a Docker container. Some of them include:
Configuring the maximum amount of memory a container can use.
To limit the maximum amount of memory usage for a container, add the --memory option to the docker run command. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut -m.
$ sudo docker run -it --memory=”[memory_limit]” [docker_image]
**by the suffix b, k, m, or g (short for bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes)
Ex: sudo docker run -it --memory=”2g” ubuntu
2. Setting the soft limit for the amount of memory assigned to a container.
you can set a soft limit (--memory-reservation) which warns when the container reaches the end of its assigned memory 
$ sudo docker run -it --memory=”1g” --memory-reservation=”750m” ubuntu
soft limit is always lower than the maximum space capacity.
3. Limit Docker Container CPU Usage
Giving containers unlimited CPU usage can lead to issues. So we have to definr the CPU resources from the host machine.
$ sudo docker run -it --cpus=”1.5” ubuntu /bin/bash  # to use 1.5cpu from 2cpu
