What is Sub-Module and why we need sub module
Git submodules allow you to keep a git repository as a subdirectory of another git repository. 
Git submodules are simply a reference to another repository at a particular snapshot in time.
When adding a submodule to a repository a new .gitmodules file will be created. The .gitmodules file contains 
meta data about the mapping between the submodule project's URL and local directory.
git submodule add https://bitbucket.org/j
git clone /url/to/repo/with/submodules
git submodule init
git submodule update

How to delete local branch and remote branch
Deleting a branch LOCALLY:
Git will not let you delete the branch you are currently on so you must make sure to checkout a branch
$ git branch -d <branch>.  ----> -d option will delete the branch only if it has already been pushed and merged with the remote branch
EX: git branch -d fix/authentication
$ git branch -D <branch>. -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't been pushed or merged yet.
Deleting a branch REMOTELY: 
$ git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name>
OR
$ git push <remote_name> :<branch_name>
If you get the error as push failed then use
$ git fetch -p  --->  -p flag means "prune". and try to sync the branch list.


Diff b/w git diff and git status
git satus only shows the modified files which are to be added
git diff shows the file content and matter that was modified by comparing with previous commit.
