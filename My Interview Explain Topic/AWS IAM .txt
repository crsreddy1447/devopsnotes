AWS Identity and Access Management
AWS IAM to securely control individual and group access to your AWS resources. You can create and manage user identities ("IAM users") and grant permissions for those IAM users to access your resources. You can also grant permissions for users outside of AWS ( federated users).

Manage IAM permissions:
To assign permissions to a user, group, role, or resource, you create a policy  using:

Resources – Which AWS resources you allow the action on. For example: S3 buckets will you allow the user to perform.
Effect – Whether to allow or deny access. 
Conditions – Which conditions must be present for the policy to take effect. For example: S3 delete condition is deny.
