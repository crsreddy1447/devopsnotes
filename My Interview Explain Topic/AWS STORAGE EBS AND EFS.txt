Amazon Elastic Block Store and Amazon Elastic File System and AWS Storage Gateway

Amazon Elastic Block Store: 
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.
Multiple volumes to one instance and vice versa
EBS volumes are created in a specific Availability Zone, and can then be attached to any instances in that same Availability Zone. To make a volume available outside of the Availability Zone, you can create a snapshot and restore that snapshot to a new volume
Amazon EBS provides the following volume types: 
1. General Purpose SSD base performance of 3 IOPS/GiB, with the ability to burst to 3,000 IOPS for extended periods of time.
volume can range in size from 1 GiB to 16 TiB.

2. Provisioned IOPS SSD: support up to 64,000 IOPS and 1,000 MiB/s of throughput
Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes are designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads, particularly database workloads

3. Throughput Optimized HDD: provide low-cost magnetic storage that defines performance in terms of throughput rather than IOPS.
4. Cold HDD: low-cost magnetic storage that defines performance in terms of throughput rather than IOPS
5. Magnetic

### AWS CLI EBS

aws ec2 attach-volume --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0 --instance-id i-01474ef662b89480 --device /dev/sdf
aws ec2 describe-volumes


### Amazon Elastic File System:

Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) is a fully-managed service that provides a simple, scalable, fully managed, elastic NFS file system. It is built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files.
Amazon EFS file systems can automatically scale from gigabytes to petabytes of data without needing to provision storage.

EFS offers two storage classes: 
Standard storage class, and 
Infrequent Access storage class (EFS IA)

To access your file system, you mount the file system on an Amazon EC2 Linux-based instance using the standard Linux mount command and the file systemâ€™s DNS name. 
Amazon EFS uses the Network File System version 4 (NFS v4) protocol. 
AWS DataSync provides a fast and simple way to securely sync existing file systems with Amazon EFS.
Amazon EFS supports 1000 Amazon EC2 instances connecting to a file system concurrently.
You can create up to 1,000 file systems per region.


#### AWS Storage Gateway
AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage.
The gateway connects to AWS storage services. The service includes a highly-optimized data transfer mechanism, with bandwidth management, automated network resilience, and efficient data transfer.

The service includes a highly-optimized data transfer mechanism, with bandwidth management, automated network resilience, and efficient data transfer.

File Gateway:  File Gateway presents a file-based interface to Amazon S3, which appears as a network file share. It enables you to store and retrieve Amazon S3 objects through standard file storage protocols.

Tape Gateway: Tape Gateway is a cloud-based Virtual Tape Library (VTL). It presents your backup application with a VTL interface, consisting of a media changer and tape drives. You can create virtual tapes in your virtual tape library using the AWS Management Console. 

Volume Gateway: Volume Gateway provides an iSCSI target, which enables you to create block storage volumes and mount them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises or EC2 application servers. The Volume Gateway runs in either a cached or stored mode.
